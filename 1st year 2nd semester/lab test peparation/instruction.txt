Dear students, 
For your labtest, as I've told in the class that for C part, you have to do program using function. Also    do practice on structure & string.
For OOP, You'll be given  problems on inheritance & operator overloading. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: No pen drive & cell phone along with any digital gadgets  is allowed during the labtest.quiz will be held in your classrooms at TE workshop building @10.30am.
Have a good preparation. 
All the best.
